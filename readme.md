#Description
The game runs on the commands of two players involved. Each has their turn to roll the dice. For each roll, the outcome is displayed as the "Turn Score" and when the player clicks the hold button, they get their "Total Score". When the outcome of a roll is 1, then the score reverts to zero. The objective of the game is to attain 100 points and the first player to get to 100 wins the round of play.

#BDD
The program has two player profiles set; Player One and Player Two, both of which roll the dice during their turn


Example input: Roll = 1
Example output: 0
The application awards a zero score when the player has a roll outcome of 1 and reverts their previous total score to 0

Example input: Hold
Example output: The player's total score is generated and displayed
